# cozmo-alive
This project is to give Anki Cozmo a life. Written based on zayfod's pycozmo library.
Only runs on Windows (at this point).

# Instructions
1. Download ffmpeg from here: https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases
2. Extract the file and place ```ffmpeg.exe``` into the root folder of this repo
3. Open command prompt with python3.9 installed (a virtual environment is recommended)
4. Run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Open the ```playground.ipynb``` file on Jupyter Notebook

This is still under development. Will convert this into a .py file once it's completed.
